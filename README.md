# PishKhooneh Project

Internet Engineering Project

## Project description:

PishKhooneh software serves as a platform that empowers homeowners and real estate consultants to list their properties for sale or mortgage. Users can furnish comprehensive property details, including building age, size, usage type, area, and more. By pinpointing the property's geographical coordinates on an online map, they can effectively share it with potential buyers. In addition to seller-centric features, PishKhooneh offers an array of amenities for buyers and other users.

One of the standout features of PishKhooneh software is its ability to provide free house price predictions through an intelligent system. This system leverages market data to offer users a real-time price range, ensuring that they have an accurate understanding of prevailing market rates. This functionality enables them to make informed decisions when buying or selling property. The platform also boasts a dynamic listing system, allowing users to view the latest property listings and apply filters to customize their search based on criteria such as title, area, room count, and price range. Users can access individual property pages to explore detailed features, view the property's geographic location on a map, and review price trends over the past months.

Furthermore, PishKhooneh offers users a personal dashboard where they can manage their property listings and personal information. Upon registration, users are assigned the bronze level of access, which limits them to listing a maximum of three properties. However, users can upgrade their access level on their personal dashboard by making a payment, granting them the capability to list additional properties. The software is accessible via web browsers and mobile applications for both Android and iOS devices, ensuring users have convenient access anytime, anywhere, as long as they are connected to the internet.
